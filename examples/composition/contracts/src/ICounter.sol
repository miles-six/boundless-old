// Counter is a simple contract that increments a counter for each address that calls increment.
// The increment function takes a seal and a journal digest, where the seal contains the proof of inclusion
// (empty in case of singleton proofs) and verifies it using the SetVerifier contract.
// If the verification is successful, the journal digest is marked as verified,
// so that can't be reused, and the counter is incremented.
// It could be used to play a sort of game where each player has to submit as many unique proofs
// coming from the market to increment their counter.
