Boundless is the first universal ZK protocol that transforms how developers build with zero-knowledge proofs across any chain.
Core to Boundless is a decentralized proof market. Competitive proving services ensure reliable delivery, liveness, and best-in-class pricing.

This crate is the SDK for interacting with the Boundless Market.
