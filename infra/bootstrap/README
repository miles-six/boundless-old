# Bootstrap

The stack is used to bootstrap a service accounts with resources that are needed for deployments. 

If you are trying to onboard for development, see `./infra/README`

## Staging / Prod

This stack should only be needed to be deployed once, when a new service account is created.

Must be deployed as an admin user in each service account.

Currently this creates a deployment role that is assumed by the ops account in order to deploy Boundless services cross-account, and a VPC.

Each service account has its own Pulumi stack file, since stacks are coupled to AWS accounts.

To update staging:

```
pulumi login "s3://boundless-pulumi-state?region=us-west-2&awssdk=v2"
pulumi stack select services-staging
pulumi up
```
