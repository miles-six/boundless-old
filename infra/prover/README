# Development

Prerequisite: onboard to the development account. See `infra/README`.

1. Create a `.env` file in this directory.

```
BONSAI_API_KEY=""
PULUMI_CONFIG_PASSPHRASE=""
PRIVATE_KEY=""
ETH_RPC_URL=""
DEV_NAME=""
AWS_REGION="us-west-2"
ORDER_STREAM_URL=""
DOCKER_REMOTE_BUILDER=""
```

`PULUMI_CONFIG_PASSPHRASE` can be left blank as we do not use that feature.
`DEV_NAME` should be your name. This is used to name resources that you create.

1. pulumi login --local
2. pulumi stack select dev
3. pulumi up

## Bento EC2 Development

To enable SSH access to the instance set env variable `BENTO_PROVER_SSH_PUBLIC_KEY` with a public key before `pulumi up`. You can then ssh in using `ssh ubuntu@<bentoBrokerPublicDns>` (`bentoBrokerPublicDns` is outputted by pulumi up).

Useful commands when ssh'd into the instance:

```
# View logs from userData start up:
sudo cat /var/log/cloud-init-output.log

lsblk -o NAME,SIZE -d

df -h

# View logs from systemd service for the broker
sudo journalctl -e -u boundless-broker
sudo journalctl -u boundless-broker

# Check service status
sudo systemctl status boundless-broker.service

# Check dependencies of service status
systemctl list-dependencies boundless-broker.service

# Get env variables of running service
systemctl show boundless-broker --property=Environment

# View logs of cloudwatch agent
cat /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/logs/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.log

# View docker logs
cd /local/boundless
docker ps -a
# View tail broker logs
docker compose logs --tail=100 bento-broker-1
# View broker logs
docker compose logs bento-broker-1
# View logs including bento:
docker compose logs bento-broker-1
```
