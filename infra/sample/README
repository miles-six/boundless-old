# Sample

A sample Pulumi stack that can be cloned to get started.

The development stack can be deployed to any AWS account. It does not use any production resources like our Pulumi state bucket or secrets key.

And two for staging and prod that can only be deployed to the staging and prod AWS accounts respectively. These stacks use our production secrets manager and KMS key, as well as our production Pulumi state bucket.

## Local Development

During development, you should deploy the dev stack to a testing AWS account (e.g. the Boundless Dev Account).

When developing locally, you use a local Pulumi backend, and you do not have access to the secret provider that we use in staging/prod.

Steps are:

1. Log into the development account as an Admin (e.g. via aws-vault)
2. `pulumi login --local && pulumi stack init dev`
3. `pulumi stack init dev`
4. `pulumi up`

## Secrets

For secrets in staging and production we use Pulumi's secret management with a KMS key managed by the ops account. The development account admin role has permissions to create secrets using the KMS key. Follow these steps to set up secrets for staging and prod:

1. Log into development account as an Admin (e.g. via aws-vault)
2. `pulumi login "s3://boundless-pulumi-state?region=us-west-2&awssdk=v2"` 
3. `pulumi stack select staging`
4. `pulumi config set --secret sampleSecret secretValue`
5. `pulumi stack select prod`
6. `pulumi config set --secret sampleSecret secretValue`

Note for local development, we do not use the secret management. You should use environment variables.

## Deploying to Staging and Production

The deployment pipeline is configured to deploy to staging on merge to `main`, and require manual approval (in AWS CodePipeline in the ops account) to deploy to prod.
