# Builder

The builder is an EC2 instance with Docker installed for running remote Docker builds. This is useful during development on M1 Macs when we need to build images that target `amd64`, since the M1 emulation is slow and often fails.

It is only deployed to the dev account, so there is only one stack: `Pulumi.dev.yaml`. Unlike other "dev" stacks, this one uses a shared S3 state bucket and secret provider, since we share a single instance amongst the team.

## Using the builder
### Prerequisite 
1. Get the SSH key from the team vault under "Boundless Builder SSH"
2. Add the key to your ssh agent: `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_dev_docker_builder`

### On each use
1. Login as developer admin using aws-vault or similar
2. Run `./configure_builder.sh`
3. Now when you run `pulumi up` the docker builds will run remotely.
4. When done using the builder, you can stop the instance to save costs: `./stop_builder.sh`

## Development

Only needed if you are modifying the builder's Pulumi and want to redeploy it from scratch.

As developer admin:
```
pulumi login "s3://boundless-builder-state20250415161708046300000001?region=us-west-2&awssdk=v2"
pulumi up
```
